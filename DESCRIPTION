Description: Package designed to be used with Rscript to write
    ``#!'' shebang scripts that accept short and long flags/options.
    Many users will prefer using instead the packages optparse or argparse
    which add extra features like automatically generated help option and usage,
    support for default values, positional argument support, etc.
